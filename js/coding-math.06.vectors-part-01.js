/*
Vector (V)
start point is called: tail
finish point is called: head


Direction (Angle)
is the angle where the Vector is pointed in
usually in Degrees an Radians

Magnitude (length)
M
is the length of arrow (tail,
 head)

Representation
->
AB (AB with a arrow over)

->
0B (0B with a arrow over if A = 0)
->
B (B with a arrow over if A = 0,
 same as above)

V
Vector
if B = 7, 4 and A = 0:
V = (7, 4)

X = M * CosA
Y = M * SinA

V1 = (x1, y2)
V2 = (x2, y2)

Addition
V3 = (x1 + x2, x2 + y2)

Subtraction
V3 = (x1 - x2, x2 - y2)

Multiplication (Dot Product or Cross Product)
S
Scale Multiplication

V x S
V3 = (x1 * 2, x2 * 2)

Division
V3 = (x1 / 2, x2 / 2)
